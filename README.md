# Excercise on Objects in Wesbos's Javacript beginner tutorial

Amazing tutorial. I definately recomended to check it out. Visit course website here: https://wesbos.com/beginner-javascript 

\u1F4A1 When comparing two obcjects by type (person1 === person2), why do we get false?

    - When you are comparing objects it is done by referencing to the object itself, not the values inside of it. 
    
    Even though the content inside the object may be the same they are not because they same different reference!

    String only can have a value; object can have multiple things inside of them (item/values).

When objects, and arrays are copied by reference

 :bulb: When we created const person3, we created variable that JUST points to original varialbe, instead of making it a copy of it.
